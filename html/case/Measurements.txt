Abstract

We're interested in designing a compact case for our webserver based on raspberry pi.
Concretely we're going to attach a 7" screen to rpi in order to visualize which's happening in the server when we'll use it face to face.
The designed case should satisfied at least the next points:
  + It will have less than 20 cm of width and 12 cm of heigh, there isn't deep dimension constraint.
  + Ethenet and USB ports should be placed in one lateral surface. HDMI port should be place in the orthogonal side.
  + HDMI ports of screen controller should be placed under/above HDMI rpi port and on the surface of the case.
  + There will be holes for everyports.
  + There will be holes for two buttons of 11 mm of diameter and for two LED diodes of 5 mm
